# [ðŸ”—](test/merged-md/test2/TesterContract2.sol#L3) TesterContract2
**Author** _Dill Pickles_

This should be directly under the contract, where I am providing additional markdown documentation on the second file.

A contract for testing the ability of this forked doc generator to make clean output files.



It should ideally support proper linebreaks but only when they are desired.



Another cool thing is the ability to make lists like such:

- this is the first item this should still be part of #1
- this is the second item

## [ðŸ”—](test/merged-md/test2/TesterContract2.sol#L22) `test1(uint256 a, uint256 b)`

This section should appear under developer notes.




### Parameters
* `a` The first parameter, which may or may not be overloaded.
* `b` The second parameter, which is good for eating spaghettios with.
### Returns
* `uint256` The product of `a` and `b`

## [ðŸ”—](test/merged-md/test2/TesterContract2.sol#L32) `test1(uint256 a)`

This section should appear directly under the function name, because I will only provide a markdown input for the first function.




### Parameters
* `a` The first parameter, which may or may not be overloaded.
### Returns
* `uint256` The product of `a` and `20`
